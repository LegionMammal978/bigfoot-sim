# bigfoot-sim

This program simulates the evolution of “Bigfoot”, a 3-state 3-symbol Turing machine. It can be established heuristically that this machine never halts, but it cannot easily be proven for certain. More information can be found in the article “[BB(3, 3) is Hard](https://www.sligocki.com/2023/10/16/bb-3-3-is-hard.html)” by Shawn Ligocki.

The basis of this program is the reduced representation $C(a,b)=A(a,4b+1,2)$, which can be expressed in the form $C(a,81k+r)\to C(a+\Delta a,256k+s)$ given an 81-entry table of $(r,\Delta a,s)$ entries. Each iteration of $C$ corresponds to 4 iterations of $A$. To speed up processing, the program operates in a cycle of decomposing $b=81^8k+R$, performing 8 iterations starting with $C(a,R)$ to obtain $S$, and recombining $b'=256^8k+S$. Additionally, the program stores $b$ as an array of base-$81^8$ “limbs”, so that dividing by $81^8$ is trivial, and multiplying by $256^8$ can be performed by multiple threads working in parallel.

The program should be invoked as `bigfoot-sim logfile.txt [savefile.txt] [restorefile.txt]`. Bot the log and save files can be set to `/dev/null`. At the start of every cycle, the program will write a line to the log file with the 0-based cycle number (i.e., the reduced iteration count divided by 8), followed by the values of $a$, $b\bmod256^8$, and $b\bmod81^8$. (Note that the program always operates on the reduced value of $b$. The full $A(a,b,c)$ representation can be recovered by computing $4b+1$.) Every second, it will write a line to the standard output stream with the full iteration count (i.e., the reduced iteration count times 4), followed by the values of $a$ and $b\bmod81^8$. If a save file is specified, the program will dump its entire state to the file every 60 seconds; this save file can later be used as a restore file to resume the calculation.
